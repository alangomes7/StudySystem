# Study System API

Welcome to the Study System API, a comprehensive RESTful service for managing students, courses, professors, and their academic interactions. This API provides a complete set of endpoints for performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on all major entities of the system.

This application is built with Java and the Spring Boot framework.

## Features

- **Student Management**: Add, update, retrieve, and delete student records.
- **Course Management**: Manage the course catalog.
- **Professor Management**: Handle professor information.
- **Class Management**: Create and manage class schedules, linking courses and professors.
- **Subscription Management**: Enroll students in classes and manage their subscriptions.

## Prerequisites

- Java 17 or later
- Maven 3.6 or later
- An active instance of the application running, typically on `http://localhost:8080`.

## How to Run

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/alangomes7/StudySystem
    cd StudySystem
    ```

2.  Build and run the application using Maven:
    ```bash
    mvn spring-boot:run
    ```

The API will be available at `http://localhost:8080`.

## API Endpoints & Usage Examples

Below are examples of how to interact with the API using `curl`. You can run these commands in your terminal.

*(Note: IDs like `1`, `999`, etc., are placeholders. You should use actual IDs generated by the application when making requests.)*

### Study Classes (`/study-classes`)

A Study Class links a `Course` and a `Professor` for a specific academic term. You must have a course and a professor created first to get their IDs.

**1. Create a new Study Class**
*(Assumes a course with ID 1 and a professor with ID 1 exist)*
```bash
curl --location 'http://localhost:8080/study-classes' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{
    "year": 2024,
    "semester": 1,
    "courseId": 1,
    "professorId": 1
}'
```

**2. Delete a Study Class**
*(This will also delete all student subscriptions to this class)*
```bash
curl --location --request DELETE 'http://localhost:8080/study-classes/1'
```

---

### Subscriptions (`/subscriptions`)

A Subscription links a `Student` to a `StudyClass`. You must have a student and a study class created first to get their IDs.

**1. Create a new Subscription (Enroll a Student in a Class)**
*(Assumes a student with ID 1 and a study class with ID 1 exist)*
```bash
curl --location 'http://localhost:8080/subscriptions' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{
    "studentId": 1,
    "studyClassId": 1

### Testing for Not Found Errors (404)

You can test the error handling by requesting an entity that does not exist.

**Get Student with an Invalid ID**
```bash
curl --location 'http://localhost:8080/students/999'
```

**Get Course with an Invalid ID**
```bash
curl --location 'http://localhost:8080/courses/999'
```

**Get Professor with an Invalid ID**
```bash
curl --location 'http://localhost:8080/professors/999'
```
